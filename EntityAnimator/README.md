# Entity animator Radium Plugin example

This plugins shows how to animate the transform of an Entity.

By default, the transform of an Entity is editable but not animatable.
This plugin creates a KeyFramedValue bound to the transform of each new Entity
and gives it to the Timeline.
Hence, users can then define keyframes for the Entity's transform using the
Timeline UI.
